        <p>Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML,
             CSS and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly.
             The challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the
              front end of a website change constantly and so the developer needs to constantly be aware of how the field is developing.</p>

          <p>The objective of designing a site is to ensure that when the users open up the site they see the information in a format
            that is easy to read and relevant. This is further complicated by the fact that users now use a large variety of devices 
            with varying screen sizes and resolutions thus forcing the designer to take into consideration these aspects when designing 
            the site.</p>  
            <p>
             They need to ensure that their site comes up correctly in different browsers (cross-browser), different operating systems
              (cross-platform) and different devices (cross-device), which requires careful planning on the side of the developer.</p>
